<h1><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin" target="_blank"> Odin </a> , the Father of all.</h1>
<img src="Images/Odin.jpg" width="500", height="500">
<p> God of Gods: <strong> <em> He rules over Asgard.</em></strong> </p>
<div><p>Odin appears as a prominent god throughout the recorded history of <strong> Northern </strong>  Europe, from the Roman occupation of regions of Germania (from c.  2 BCE) through movement of peoples during the Migration Period (4th to 6th centuries CE) and the Viking Age (8th to 11th centuries CE). In the modern period the rural folklore of Germanic Europe continued to acknowledge Odin. References to him appear in place names throughout regions historically inhabited by the ancient Germanic peoples, and the day of the week Wednesday bears his name in many Germanic languages, including in English.</p></div>

<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor"> Thor </a>, the God of Thunder.</h2>

<p><em>He is the son of Odin.</em></p>
<div><p>Thor is a prominently mentioned god throughout the recorded history of the Germanic peoples, from the Roman occupation of regions of Germania, to the Germanic expansions of the Migration Period, to his high popularity during the Viking Age, when, in the face of the process of the Christianization of Scandinavia, emblems of his hammer, Mjölnir, were worn and Norse pagan personal names containing the name of the god bear witness to his popularity.</p></div>

<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loki">Loki</a> , the God of Mischief.</h3>
<img src="Images/Loki.jpg" width="500", height="500">
<p><em>He is also the son of Odin, however, he is a <strong>stepson.</strong></em></p>
<div><p>Loki (/ˈloʊki/) is a god in Norse mythology. According to some sources, Loki is the son of Fárbauti (a jötunn) and Laufey (mentioned as a goddess), and the brother of Helblindi and Býleistr. Loki is married to Sigyn and they have two sons, Narfi and Nari or Váli. By the jötunn Angrboða, Loki is the father of Hel, the wolf Fenrir, and the world serpent Jörmungandr. In the form of a mare, Loki was impregnated by the stallion Svaðilfari and gave birth to the eight-legged horse Sleipnir.</p></div>
